NodeJS-Backend for App and Website

Hi,

We need a backend that provides same functionality like Doodle. So the backend will provide functionality to create events with several sugegsted dates/times, invite members to these events and let the members vote on which times they can join the event.
The backend will provide the functionality for a website and for an app. You only have to develop the backend and not a frontend.
We want you to use:
- NodeJS
- REST interface for interaction. Protocol will be given by us
- MongoDB (or suggest another database in your offer, with a reason please)

Everything else is up to you. We just need you to stay object-oriented and modular inside your code.

We will provide a very simple frontend, using a REST interface with a communication protocol we defined.

Here's a list of features the backend has to provide:
- Login via Facebook
- 

REST INTERFACE

SPECIFY MILESTONES
We want you to define milestones in maximum 2-day steps. It's not a nogo for us if you notice during development that you need a little bit longer for a single milestone, but we want to see that you have a realistic plan for the development.
We give you a 100$ initially for providing us milestones
Please plan 25% of the costs on the final delivery milestone.
